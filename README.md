Volcano Monitoring Using CNN

This project focuses on identifying the time till the eruption of a volcano using the images of its smoke. The project mainly classifies the volcano as either erupting within 1-2 months, 3-6 months, or more than 6 months. This project helps in monitoring volcanos in extremely rural and rugged regions, as the necessary seismometers can't be installed in these regions due to high cost and maintenance. 

this model also aims to reduce the error in seismic readings which can misinterpret iceberg collisions, human-made tremors, and tremors from other regions as volcanic tremors, which may lead to stoppages in air and water routes, causing a major financial loss

The dataset has been custom labeled, and the images have been gathered from the Smithsonian Institution
